One of the main features of Argon is the extreme ability to customize it to your liking. This page will guide you through the process of configuring Argon to fit your needs.

## Argon CLI

Argon command line interface is configurable through two main ways.

### Command Options

When running `argon`, you can add options to customize the behavior of the [Commands](./commands/cli.mdx). Here are some examples:

- `--docs` or `-d` - Include documentation in the project
- `--template` or `-T` - Select the project template

### Global Config

Argon has a global config file that can be used to set default settings for the CLI. The configuration file is located at:

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.argon\config.toml`
- macOS & Linux: `~/.argon/config.toml`

And can have the following settings:

| Setting        | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| port           | `8000`       | Default server port when live syncing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| template       | `place`      | Default project [Template](./getting-started/new-project.mdx#project-templates) to use when creating a new project with `argon init`. Argon comes with five templates: **place**, **plugin**, **package**, **model** and **quick**. But you can add your own! Just create a new folder with the desired name and contents in `.argon/templates/`                                                  |

| use_wally      | `false`      | Whether to use use [Wally](https://wally.run/) for project package management.
